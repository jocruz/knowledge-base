# Hello World!

#### **Web Application Security Knowledge Base**

**Introduction**

Welcome, and thank you for visiting my **Web Application Security Knowledge Base**. This resource serves as a **technical portfolio** that highlights my expertise in **web application penetration testing, security research, and exploit development**. Whether you're a **hiring manager, recruiter, or security professional**, this GitBook provides a detailed look at my skills, methodologies, and hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

***

#### **Why This GitBook?**

This GitBook is a **living documentation** of my knowledge and practical experience in **web security**, built through extensive research, training, and real-world application. It showcases:

* **Deep dives into web vulnerabilities**, from **SQL Injection and NoSQL Injection** to **Race Conditions and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**.
* **Hands-on exploitation techniques**, including **real-world case studies, PortSwigger Labs solutions, and independent research projects**.
* **My approach to penetration testing**, shaped by professional training, security certifications, and a background in full-stack development.

***

#### **Certifications & Professional Training**

To solidify my expertise in **web application security**, I have completed multiple **practical penetration testing certifications** from **TCM Security** and **CompTIA Security+**. These certifications are **real-world simulations**, requiring **hands-on exploitation and professional report writing**—skills that are essential for a penetration tester.

**1. Practical Web Pentest Professional (PWPP) Certification**

The **PWPP** is a **professional-level web penetration testing certification** that evaluates an individual’s ability to perform **full-scale web application penetration tests**. The exam requires candidates to:

* **Identify and exploit advanced web vulnerabilities**, including **NoSQL Injection, Race Conditions, Mass Assignment, SSRF, and Template Injection**.
* **Perform a full security assessment** on a **realistic web application**, similar to professional engagements.
* **Write a professional penetration testing report**, detailing findings, risk assessments, and remediation strategies.

The **PWPP is not a CTF-style exam**—it is a **real-world web application penetration testing simulation**, ensuring that certified individuals can **apply their skills in practical security assessments**.

**2. Practical Web Pentest Associate (PWPA) Certification**

The **PWPA** is an **associate-level web penetration testing certification** that introduces candidates to **real-world web exploitation techniques**. It covers:

* **Identification and exploitation of common web vulnerabilities**, including **SQL Injection, File Inclusion, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.
* **Practical application of attack vectors**, using **industry-standard tools and methodologies**.
* **Comprehensive security report writing**, ensuring findings are clearly communicated with technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Like the **PWPP**, the **PWPA** follows a **real-world penetration testing approach**, rather than CTF challenges, making it highly relevant to **professional consulting and security roles**.

**3. Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) Certification**

The **PJPT** is an **internal network penetration testing certification**, designed to assess **Active Directory exploitation skills**. It requires candidates to:

* **Enumerate Active Directory environments**, identify misconfigurations, and escalate privileges.
* **Perform lateral and vertical movement**, compromising multiple machines within a **Windows domain environment**.
* **Fully compromise a Windows Domain Controller**, demonstrating proficiency in **internal network penetration testing**.

The **PJPT complements my web security skills**, as modern **web applications often integrate with internal networks, cloud services, and authentication mechanisms** that require **Active Directory knowledge for privilege escalation**.

**4. CompTIA Security+ (Sec+)**

[View Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/7d06c8d7-ce80-4094-b87d-4ddced0d0bce/public_url)

The **CompTIA Security+ (Sec+ 701)** certification provides a **strong foundation in cybersecurity principles**, covering **risk management, security architecture, network security, and incident response**. While Security+ is a broader certification, it complements my **offensive security skills** by reinforcing knowledge of **secure system design, cryptography, and access control mechanisms**.

***

#### **My Experience & Approach to Web Application Security**

These certifications, combined with my **background in full-stack development**, have shaped my **methodical approach to web application penetration testing**.

* **I have performed web penetration tests** in both structured training environments (**PortSwigger Labs, TCM Security exams**) and **internal web applications**.
* **I specialize in identifying and exploiting complex vulnerabilities**, going beyond basic injection attacks to **business logic flaws, deserialization issues, and race conditions**.
* **I apply professional methodologies**, ensuring my security assessments follow **industry standards** such as **OWASP, NIST, and PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**.

With a **deep understanding of both web development and offensive security**, I can **analyze security vulnerabilities from multiple perspectives**—not only **how attackers exploit them** but also **how developers can secure applications against these threats**.

***

#### **What You’ll Find in This Knowledge Base**

This GitBook is designed to serve as a **comprehensive resource** on web security, featuring:

* **Technical breakdowns** of web vulnerabilities (**SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, XSS, SSRF, Race Conditions, File Inclusion, and more**).
* **Hands-on security research**, with **real-world examples and exploitation scenarios**.
* **Walkthroughs of web application penetration tests**, using **PortSwigger Web Security Academy, Hack The Box, and custom-built applications**.
* **Professional penetration testing methodologies**, including **OWASP Testing Guide practices and report writing guidelines**.

***

#### **My Goal**

I am looking to join a **security-driven team** where I can contribute my **expertise in web application security, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment**. My focus is on **helping organizations identify and remediate security flaws**, ensuring their applications remain resilient against modern threats.

If you’re interested in **hiring a skilled web application penetration tester**, I invite you to **explore my work, review my certifications, and connect with me**.
