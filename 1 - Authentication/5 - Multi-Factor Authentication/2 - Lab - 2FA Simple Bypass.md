## **High-Level Summary of the Lab**

1. **Objective**: Exploit a logic flaw in the 2FA implementation to access a victim's account without needing their 2FA code.
    
2. **Steps**:
    
    - Log in to your account to understand the 2FA flow and observe the behavior in Burp Suite.
    - Analyze the session cookies from the `/login` and `/login2` requests to identify differences.
    - Test if the session cookie from the initial login request can be reused without completing 2FA.
    - Bypass the 2FA requirement by directly navigating to a restricted page (`/my-account`) after logging in with the victim's credentials.
3. **Techniques Used**:
    
    - Session cookie analysis to exploit improper session state management.
    - URL manipulation to bypass multi-step authentication mechanisms.
4. **Key Learning**:
    
    - Mismanagement of session cookies can allow attackers to bypass authentication steps like 2FA.
    - Testing for logical flaws in multi-step authentication workflows is critical during assessments.

## **What to Do Next (Exam Simulation)**

- On an exam, analyze session cookies during multi-step authentication to test for state mismanagement.
- Attempt direct navigation to sensitive endpoints when 2FA is involved.
- Use Burp Suite to intercept and replay requests while modifying session cookies or other parameters.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **If accessing `/my-account` fails**:
    - Verify that you are correctly reusing the initial session cookie (`CookieA`).
    - Confirm that the victim's credentials were used correctly during login.
- **If cookies seem invalid**:
    - Ensure cookies are being sent with every request.
    - Double-check for cookie scope issues (e.g., domain, path, or expiration).

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- Session cookies are often the source of authorization and should be analyzed for vulnerabilities.
- Applications that fail to enforce 2FA consistently across sensitive endpoints are prone to logical flaws.
- Multi-step authentication does not inherently protect against session-based vulnerabilities.

## **Step 1: Log In to Your Own Account**

1. Navigate to the login page and log in with your own credentials.
2. Complete the 2FA step by retrieving the code sent to your email.
3. Observe two distinct POST requests in Burp Suite:
    - `/login`: Sends username and password.
    - `/login2`: Sends the 2FA code.

---

## **Step 2: Analyze Session Cookies**

1. In Burp Suite, capture the traffic during login and 2FA steps.
    - **CookieA**: Issued after `/login`.
    - **CookieB**: Issued after `/login2`.
2. Note the differences between the cookies:
    - **CookieA** might still authorize certain actions even without completing 2FA.

---

## **Step 3: Test Victim Login Flow**

1. Log out of your account and log in using the victim's credentials.
2. When prompted for the 2FA code, intercept the request.
3. Observe whether the session cookie (`CookieA`) has been set.

---

## **Step 4: Attempt Direct Navigation**

1. Without entering the victim's 2FA code, manually modify the URL to navigate to `/my-account`.
2. Observe the response:
    - If the page loads successfully, the application is relying solely on `CookieA` for authorization.

---

## **Step 5: Confirm the Flaw**

1. Repeat the process:
    - Log in as the victim.
    - Navigate directly to `/my-account` without completing the 2FA step.
2. Verify that access is granted due to the persistent authorization from `CookieA`.

---

## **Key Learning Point**

The vulnerability arises because the backend fails to invalidate `CookieA` or enforce the 2FA completion state before granting access to sensitive endpoints.
