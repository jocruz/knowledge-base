# Pentesting HTB: Doctor

## **Welcome to My Hack The Box: Doctor Walkthrough**

Hey there! This page serves as a **prelude** to my **HTB: Doctor** walkthrough, where I demonstrate **real-world web application penetration testing skills** with a focus on the **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**.

### **üí° Why This Walkthrough Matters**

* **For Employers**: This is a showcase of my **hands-on experience** with web app security, demonstrating **methodical enumeration**, **exploitation techniques**, and **privilege escalation strategies**.
* **For Aspiring Pentesters**: If you're learning, this walkthrough is structured to help you **understand the mindset** behind each step, from initial recon to root access.

### **üîç What You'll See in This Walkthrough**

* **Systematic Web Enumeration** ‚Üí Identifying attack vectors with **Nmap, Burp Suite, and manual analysis**.
* **Exploitation of Web Vulnerabilities** ‚Üí Discovering and abusing **SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)** to gain initial access.
* **Credential Discovery & Lateral Movement** ‚Üí Leveraging **misconfigurations in log files** to pivot users.
* **Privilege Escalation via Splunk** ‚Üí Exploiting **Splunk misconfigurations** to gain **root**.

Each section ties back to **real-world security concerns**, making this walkthrough not just an exercise, but an insight into how I **approach and execute** web application pentesting engagements.
