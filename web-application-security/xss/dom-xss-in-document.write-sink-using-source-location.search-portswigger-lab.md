## Lab: DOM XSS in `document.write` Sink Using Source `location.search`

### High-Level Summary

**Objective:** Perform a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by injecting a payload that calls the `alert()` function. This vulnerability occurs due to unsanitized user input being written directly to the DOM using `document.write`.

#### Key Techniques & Concepts

* DOM-Based XSS: The payload is injected into the Document Object Model (DOM) directly via JavaScript.
* JavaScript Sinks: Vulnerable usage of `document.write`.
* URL Manipulation: The payload is controlled via `location.search` in the URL.

#### What Makes This Vulnerable?

* The web application uses the `document.write` method to write unsanitized user input from `location.search` directly into the page, without proper escaping.
* The payload is reflected inside an `img` attribute, making it possible to break out and execute arbitrary JavaScript.

***

### Steps to Exploit

1. **Initial Test:**
   * Append a random alphanumeric string to the URL query string (`?search=test`).
   * Observe if the string is reflected somewhere on the page.
2. **Identify Reflection:**
   * Right-click and inspect the element to confirm the random string appears inside an `img src` attribute.
3. **Exploit Attempt:**
   *   Modify the URL and inject the following payload:

       ```
       "><svg onload=alert(1)>
       ```
   * Reload the page and confirm that an alert box appears.

### Instructor Solution

#### Using DOM Invader

1. Open **Burp Suite Community Edition** and navigate to:
   * **Proxy > Intercept > Browser**.
2. This opens a browser session where you can visit the lab URL.
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + C** to open the developer console and enable **DOM Invader**.
4. Enter a unique canary value into the search bar on the web application.
5. DOM Invader will identify if the input is reflected in a vulnerable sink and display a green **Exploit** button.

#### Reviewing the Vulnerable Code Path:

1. Click the **stack trace** hyperlink in **DOM Invader** to view the source code location.
2.  Identify the vulnerable code:

    ```
    document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+search+'">');
    ```
3.  The payload lands inside:

    ```
    <img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms=tpem9by9">
    ```

#### Final Exploit Payload:

Since the payload lands inside an `img` attribute, the following payload successfully breaks out and triggers the XSS:

```
"><img src=x onerror=prompt()>
```

### Explanation of Payloads and Techniques

#### Why `"><svg onload=alert(1)>` Works

* The payload closes the current `img src` attribute and introduces a new `svg` element.
* The `onload` event is triggered when the element loads, executing the `alert(1)` function.

#### Why `"><img src=x onerror=prompt()>` Works

* The payload closes the `img` attribute and introduces a new invalid `src` value.
* The `onerror` event triggers the `prompt()` function when the image fails to load.

#### Why Traditional Payloads Fail

* Angle brackets are encoded.
* The payload must escape the current HTML context safely and trigger JavaScript execution.
