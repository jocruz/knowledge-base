# Brute Force

## **Brute Force Attacks Overview**

**Page Description:**\
Brute force attacks remain one of the most fundamental yet effective techniques for gaining unauthorized access to accounts and systems. This section explores how attackers systematically guess credentials, analyze response patterns, and leverage automation tools to exploit weak authentication mechanisms. Understanding these techniques is critical for both offensive security testing and defensive mitigation strategies.

### **High-Level Summary: Brute Force Attacks**

**Brute force attacks** involve systematically attempting different username and password combinations to gain access to a system. These attacks rely on automation, wordlists, and response analysis to identify valid credentials.

#### **Key Takeaways**

* **Targets for Brute Force Attacks**
  * **Usernames**: Predictable usernames make attacks easier.
  * **Passwords**: Weak or reused passwords are highly susceptible.
  * **Email Addresses**: Frequently used as login identifiers.
* **Attackers Utilize Wordlists from Public Sources**
  * Precompiled lists such as **Seclists**, **RockYou.txt**, or custom-generated lists.
  * Can be sourced from **data breaches, common patterns, and industry-specific terms**.

***

### **Common Indicators to Monitor**

Brute force detection often relies on identifying specific response patterns:

1. **Content Length**
   * A different content length may indicate a valid response.
   * Example: Login failures return 500 bytes, but a success response is 700 bytes.
2. **Status Codes**
   * **302 Redirects** often indicate a successful login.
   * **401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden** suggest failed attempts.
3. **Error Messages**
   * Some applications expose useful clues, such as:
     * _"Invalid Username"_ → Username enumeration possible.
     * _"Incorrect Password"_ → Confirms username validity.
4. **Response Time Anomalies**
   * Slower response times could indicate **account lockout mechanisms** or **rate limiting**.

### **Brute Force Attack Execution**

#### **Finding Wordlists**

Use the following commands to locate relevant wordlists for usernames and passwords:

```bash
find /usr/share/seclists -iname "*subdomain*"
find /usr/share/seclists -iname "*username*"
```

#### **Brute Forcing with `ffuf`**

Use `ffuf` for credential brute force testing against a login form:

```bash
ffuf -request req.txt -request-proto https -mode clusterbomb \
-w /path/to/usernames.txt:FUZZUSER \
-w /path/to/passwords.txt:FUZZPASS -mc 302
```

**Explanation:**

* **`-request req.txt`** → Uses a captured login request.
* **`-mode clusterbomb`** → Tests multiple wordlists in a nested manner.
* **`-mc 302`** → Looks for successful login indicators (e.g., redirect to dashboard).

### **Defensive Measures & Mitigation**

#### **Preventative Controls**

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   * Reduces impact even if credentials are guessed.
2. **Enforce Account Lockouts & Rate-Limiting**
   * Temporary lockouts after repeated failed attempts.
   * Implement CAPTCHA or increasing delay after multiple failures.
3. **Monitor & Log Authentication Events**
   * Track failed login attempts and IP-based anomalies.
   * Use security tools like Fail2Ban, CrowdStrike, or SIEM solutions.
4. **Utilize Strong Password Policies**
   * Enforce minimum length, complexity, and rotation policies.
   * Implement password blacklists against leaked credentials.

### **Thought-Provoking Questions**

1. **How can you detect brute force attempts at a network level vs. an application level?**
2. **What role does password salting and hashing play in mitigating brute force risks?**
3. **How do attackers bypass rate limiting, and what are effective countermeasures?**

### **Final Thoughts**

Brute force attacks are one of the most straightforward yet persistent threats in authentication security. Understanding how attackers enumerate credentials and manipulate authentication flows allows security professionals to both **exploit weaknesses for testing** and **reinforce defenses against real-world attacks**.
