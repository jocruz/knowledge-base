# Introduction: Web Application Security

Web applications play a critical role in modern technology, making them a prime target for security vulnerabilities. Understanding how these vulnerabilities work, how they are exploited, and how to mitigate them is essential for ensuring secure applications.

This section provides an in-depth analysis of key web security concepts through hands-on practice and technical research. It covers the following topics:

ðŸ”¹ **Authentication & Access Control** â€“ Examining common authentication flaws, bypass techniques, and access control misconfigurations.\
ðŸ”¹ **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** â€“ Understanding how attackers manipulate server-side requests to access restricted resources.\
ðŸ”¹ **SQL Injection (SQLi)** â€“ Exploring database exploitation techniques and methods to prevent SQL injection attacks.\
ðŸ”¹ **File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)** â€“ Demonstrating how improper file handling can lead to remote code execution.\
ðŸ”¹ **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks** â€“ Investigating XML-based attacks that can leak sensitive data or compromise systems.\
ðŸ”¹ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** â€“ Breaking down different types of XSS attacks and how to prevent them.\
ðŸ”¹ **JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Security** â€“ Assessing common weaknesses in JWT authentication and how they can be exploited.\
ðŸ”¹ **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities** â€“ Understanding how improper object property control can lead to privilege escalation.\
ðŸ”¹ **WebSocket Security** â€“ Exploring WebSocket vulnerabilities and best practices for secure communication.\
ðŸ”¹ **Open Redirect Attacks** â€“ Analyzing how open redirects can be abused for phishing and other malicious purposes.\
ðŸ”¹ **Race Conditions in Web Applications** â€“ Investigating how race conditions can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.

Each topic includes:\
âœ… **Technical breakdowns** explaining how the vulnerability works.\
âœ… **Hands-on exploitation examples**, including practical labs from PortSwigger Web Security Academy.\
âœ… **Real-world attack scenarios** demonstrating the impact of these vulnerabilities.\
âœ… **Mitigation strategies** to secure applications against these threats.

By combining research, hands-on practice, and real-world insights, this section serves as a **technical knowledge base** for web application security, reinforcing both offensive security skills and defensive best practices.
